- "The plural form of the entity `account` is used in the student's solution (`accounts`), while the instructor's solution uses the singular form (`account`)."
- "The entity `savings` in the instructor's solution is singular (`savings`), but in the student's solution, it is plural and renamed to `savings_accounts.`"
- "The relation between `account` and `savings` in the instructor's solution is a simple association (`--o{ savings`), while in the student's solution, it is an inheritance relationship denoted by the ISA notation (`accounts ||--|| savings_accounts : ISA`)."
- "The relation between `account` and `chequing` in the instructor's solution is a simple association (`--o{ chequing`), while in the student's solution, there is no direct relation between these entities."
- "The relation between `account` and `depositor` in the instructor's solution is a simple association (`--o{ depositor`), while in the student's solution, it is a one-to-many association denoted by the `o--` notation (`accounts ||--o{ depositor`)."
- "The relation between `customer` and `depositor` in the instructor's solution is a one-to-many association (`customer ||--o{ depositor`), while in the student's solution, it is a many-to-many association denoted by the `o--||` notation (`depositor }o--|| customers`)."
- "The entity `depositor` in the instructor's solution has an attribute `access_date`, but in the student's solution, there is no such attribute."
- "The entity `customer` in the instructor's solution has an attribute `asset`, but in the student's solution, it is renamed to `assets`."
- "The entity `customer` in the instructor's solution has no relation with `savings_accounts`, while in the student's solution, it is related through the `depositor` entity."

## Step 4: Generation of Structured Feedback

- **Difference:** The entity `savings` in the instructor's solution is singular (`savings`), but in the student's solution, it is plural and renamed to `savings_accounts`.
  - **Hint:** You may want to reflect on the appropriateness of using plural forms for entities that represent a single type.

- **Difference:** The entity `depositor` in the instructor's solution has an attribute `access_date`, but in the student's solution, there is no such attribute.
  - **Hint:** Think about how this change impacts the design, particularly in terms of tracking depositor access information.

- **Difference:** The entity `customer` in the instructor's solution has an attribute `asset`, but in the student's solution, it is renamed to `assets`.
  - **Hint:** Consider the implications of changing a singular attribute name to a plural one.

- **Difference:** The entity `customer` in the instructor's solution has no relation with `savings_accounts`, while in the student's solution, it is related through the `depositor` entity.
  - **Hint:** Reflect on the relationship between `customer` and `savings_accounts` and whether the change in the student's solution accurately represents this relationship.

#### Relations
- **Difference:** The relation between `account` and `savings` in the instructor's solution is a simple association (`--o{ savings`), while in the student's solution, it is an inheritance relationship denoted by the `ISA` notation (`accounts ||--|| savings_accounts : ISA`).
  - **Hint:** Consider the implications of changing a simple association to an inheritance relationship.

- **Difference:** The relation between `account` and `chequing` in the instructor's solution is a simple association (`--o{ chequing`), while in the student's solution, there is no direct relation between these entities.
  - **Hint:** Reflect on the relationship between `account` and `chequing` and whether the change in the student's solution accurately represents this relationship.

- **Difference:** The relation between `account` and `depositor` in the instructor's solution is a simple association (`--o{ depositor`), while in the student's solution, it is a one-to-many association denoted by the `o--` notation (`accounts ||--o{ depositor`).
  - **Hint:** Consider the implications of changing a simple association to a one-to-many association.

- **Difference:** The relation between `customer` and `depositor` in the instructor's solution is a one-to-many association (`customer ||--o{ depositor`), while in the student's solution, it is a many-to-many association denoted by the `o--||` notation (`depositor }o--|| customers`).
  - **Hint:** Reflect on the relationship between `customer` and `depositor` and whether the change in the student's solution accurately represents this relationship.

#### Other Structural Changes
- **Difference:** The relation between `account` and `depositor` in the instructor's solution is not explicitly shown, while in the student's solution, it is shown as a one-to-many association.
  - **Hint:** Consider the importance of accurately representing relationships between entities in your ERD.

- **Difference:** The relation between `customer` and `savings_accounts` in the instructor's solution is not explicitly shown, while in the student's solution, it is shown through the `depositor` entity.
  - **Hint:** Reflect on the relationship between `customer` and `savings_accounts` and whether the change in the student's solution accurately represents this relationship.

### Instructor Feedback
#### Entities
  - **Difference:** The plural form of the entity `account` is used in the student's solution (`accounts`), while the instructor's solution uses the singular form (`account`).
    - **Possible Student Challenge:** The student might not have understood the concept of singular and plural forms in ERDs, or they might have assumed that entities should always be in the plural form.
    - **Teaching Recommendation:** Emphasize the importance of using the correct singular form for entities in ERDs, and provide examples to clarify the difference between singular and plural forms.
  - **Difference:** The entity `savings` in the instructor's solution is singular (`savings`), but in the student's solution, it is plural and renamed to `savings_accounts`.
    - **Possible Student Challenge:** The student might have misunderstood the meaning of the `savings` entity, or they might have thought that it represents multiple types of savings accounts.
    - **Teaching Recommendation:** Clarify the meaning of the `savings` entity and emphasize the importance of using consistent and descriptive names for entities.

#### Relations
  - **Difference:** The relation between `account` and `savings` in the instructor's solution is a simple association (`--o{ savings`), while in the student's solution, it is an inheritance relationship denoted by the `ISA` notation (`accounts ||--|| savings_accounts : ISA`).
    - **Possible Student Challenge:** The student might not have understood the difference between simple associations and inheritance relationships, or they might have confused the two.
    - **Teaching Recommendation:** Clearly explain the difference between simple associations and inheritance relationships, and provide examples to illustrate their use.
  - **Difference:** The relation between `account` and `chequing` in the instructor's solution is a simple association (`--o{ chequing`), while in the student's solution, there is no direct relation between these entities.
    - **Possible Student Challenge:** The student might have misunderstood the relationship between `account` and `chequing`, or they might have assumed that there is no direct relationship between these entities.
    - **Teaching Recommendation:** Emphasize the importance of accurately representing relationships between entities in ERDs, and provide examples to illustrate the different types of relationships.
  - **Difference:** The relation between `account` and `depositor` in the instructor's solution is a simple association (`--o{ depositor`), while in the student's solution, it is a one-to-many association denoted by the `o--` notation (`accounts ||--o{ depositor`).
    - **Possible Student Challenge:** The student might not have understood the difference between simple associations and one-to-many associations, or they might have confused the two.
    - **Teaching Recommendation:** Clearly explain the difference between simple associations and one-to-many associations, and provide examples to illustrate their use.
  - **Difference:** The relation between `customer` and `depositor` in the instructor's solution is a one-to-many association (`customer ||--o{ depositor`), while in the student's solution, it is a many-to-many association denoted by the `o--||` notation (`depositor }o--|| customers`).
    - **Possible Student Challenge:** The student might not have understood the difference between one-to-many and many-to-many associations, or they might have confused the two.
