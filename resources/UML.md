## Step 3: Comparison of Diagrams
- "The `Member` class in the student's solution has a method `borrowBook(book: Book): void` instead of `borrowBook(book: Book): boolean` as in the instructor's solution."
- "The association between `Member` and `Book` in the student's solution is changed to a simple association without the `borrows` keyword."

## Step 4: Generation of Structured Feedback
### Student Feedback
#### Classes
- **Difference:** The `Member` class in the student's solution has a method `borrowBook(book: Book): void` instead of `borrowBook(book: Book): boolean` as in the instructor's solution.
  - **Hint:** Consider reviewing the return type of the `borrowBook` method in the `Member` class and how it affects the overall design and functionality of the system.
#### Methods
- **Difference:** The `borrowBook` method in the `Member` class has a different return type between the student's and instructor's solutions.
  - **Hint:** Reflect on the purpose of the `borrowBook` method and whether the change in return type aligns with its intended functionality.
#### Relations
- **Difference:** The association between `Member` and `Book` in the student's solution is changed to a simple association without the `borrows` keyword.
  - **Hint:** Think about how this change impacts the design and the relationship between a member and the books they borrow. You may want to consider the need for tracking borrowed books in the system.
#### Other Structural Changes
- **Difference:** General structural differences exist between the student's and instructor's UML designs.
  - **Hint:** Review the overall structure of your design and compare it with the instructor's solution. Consider whether these differences are intentional or unintentional, and how they might affect the functionality and maintainability of your design.

### Instructor Feedback
#### Classes
- **Difference:** The `Member` class in the student's solution has a method `borrowBook(book: Book): void` instead of `borrowBook(book: Book): boolean` as in the instructor's solution.
  - **Possible Student Challenge:** The student might have misunderstood the purpose of the method, assuming that it only needs to indicate that the book has been borrowed rather than returning a boolean value to indicate whether the borrowing was successful or not.
  - **Teaching Recommendation:** Emphasize the importance of returning a boolean value from methods to indicate their success or failure, and clarify the purpose of the `borrowBook` method in the context of the `Member` class.

#### Methods
- **Difference:** The `borrowBook` method in the `Member` class returns `void` instead of `boolean`.
  - **Possible Student Challenge:** The student might have misunderstood the purpose of the method, assuming that it only needs to indicate that the book has been borrowed rather than returning a boolean value to indicate whether the borrowing was successful or not.
  - **Teaching Recommendation:** Review the purpose of methods and the importance of returning a boolean value from methods to indicate their success or failure.

#### Relations
- **Difference:** The association between `Member` and `Book` in the student's solution is changed to a simple association without the `borrows` keyword.
  - **Possible Student Challenge:** The student might have misunderstood the purpose of the `borrows` keyword, assuming that it is not necessary for the association between `Member` and `Book`.
  - **Teaching Recommendation:** Explain the purpose of the `borrows` keyword in the context of the association between `Member` and `Book`, and emphasize its importance in modeling the relationship between these two classes.
